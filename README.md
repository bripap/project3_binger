Binger Watch List

## Summary
An application that allows you to add all of the movies and TV shows you want to watch from all platforms to one "watchlist". Instead of having to open every streaming app to see what you want to watch, just log on to Binger to see what you have saved to your watchlist to make that decision easier. Mark the shows/movies off as you watch, rate and review!
